# Commercial Vehicle Accident Referral Service Landing Page

## Hero Image Status: NEEDED

The hero image has been temporarily removed from the landing page. To add a hero image:

1. Prepare your new image:
   - Save your image as `hero-image.jpg`
   - Recommended size: approximately 450x300 pixels
   - A horizontal/landscape orientation works best

2. Replace the placeholder image:
   - Upload your `hero-image.jpg` file to the `images` directory
   - Uncomment the image tag in index.html (around line 73)

3. If your image has a different filename or format:
   - Open `index.html`
   - Find the hero section (approximately line 73)
   - Uncomment and update the image tag: `<img src="./images/your-filename.jpg" alt="Attorney consulting with client" class="rounded-lg shadow-xl ml-auto" width="450" height="300">`

4. After replacing the image, commit and push your changes:
   ```
   git add images/hero-image.jpg
   git commit -m "Added hero image"
   git push origin main
   ```
