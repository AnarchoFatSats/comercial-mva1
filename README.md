## How to Replace the Hero Image

1. Prepare your new image:
   - Save your image as `hero-image.jpg`
   - Recommended size: approximately 450x300 pixels
   - A horizontal/landscape orientation works best

2. Replace the placeholder image:
   - Upload your `hero-image.jpg` file to the `images` directory
   - This will replace the existing image on the landing page

3. If your image has a different filename or format:
   - Open `index.html`
   - Find line 73 (approximately): `<img src="./images/hero-image.jpg"`
   - Change the image path to match your filename (e.g., `./images/your-filename.jpg`)

4. After replacing the image, commit and push your changes:
   ```
   git add images/hero-image.jpg
   git commit -m "Updated hero image"
   git push origin main
   ```
